## About SYSBRO

SYSBRO is a web application made with Laravel that allows the management for sellers, companies and orders. And it calculates commissions for sellers. To build this software I use:

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) - The PHP Framework
for Web Artisans.
- [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade) - Blade is template engine that is included with Laravel.
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - A Dependency Manager for PHP.
- [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent) - An object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Build fast, responsive sites with Bootstrap.
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
